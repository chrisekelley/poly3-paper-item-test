# Poly3-paper-input-test

This repo tests the paper-input widget in polymer 3.

It currently throws this error:

```
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/node_modules/@polymer/font-roboto/roboto.js net::ERR_ABORTED
```

The font-roboto repo was not converted completely - it does not offer a font-roboto/roboto.js.
